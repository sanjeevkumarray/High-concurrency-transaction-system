# Novum Studio - High-Concurrency Transaction System

## Overview
This project is a high-performance transaction processing system designed to handle **1 million daily orders** while integrating **AI/ML capabilities** for fraud detection and personalized product recommendations.

## Features
```yaml
- User Management:
  - Secure authentication using JWT-based session handling.
- Order Processing:
  - Efficient order creation with inventory management and payment handling.
- Payment Processing:
  - Event-driven payment callbacks via Kafka for real-time processing.
- Order Query & Analytics:
  - Real-time order tracking and status updates.
- AI/ML Integration:
  - Fraud Detection: Identifies suspicious transactions.
  - Product Recommendations: Generates suggestions based on user purchase history.
```

## Performance Benchmarks
```yaml
- Peak Throughput: ">= 50,000 Requests Per Second (QPS)"
- 99th Percentile Response Time: "<= 300ms"
- AI Model Inference Latency: "<= 100ms"
```

## Scalability & Disaster Recovery
```yaml
- Automatic Failover: Ensures seamless failover within 10 seconds of node failure.
- Load Balancing: Implemented via Nginx/API Gateway for optimal distribution.
- AI Model Retraining: Scheduled batch updates for fraud detection.
```

## Technology Stack
```yaml
Backend:
  - Java (Spring Boot 3) for high-performance microservices.
  - Redis for caching frequently accessed order data.
  - ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient concurrent request handling.
  - Apache Kafka for event-driven communication.

AI/ML Integration:
  - Fraud Detection: Rule-based or Logistic Regression model.
  - Product Recommendations: Collaborative filtering (Matrix Factorization, Cosine Similarity).
  - Model Deployment: FastAPI or Flask for AI service endpoints.
```

## System Architecture
```yaml
- Microservices Architecture: Spring Boot-based backend services.
- Database: Sharded PostgreSQL/MongoDB (if required).
- AI Services: Deployed using FastAPI/Flask.
- Caching Layer: Redis for low-latency data retrieval.
- Event Processing: Kafka for real-time event streaming.
```

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
```sh
# Install Java, Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, and Python 3.8+
```
### Setup Instructions
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/novum-studio-transaction-system.git
cd novum-studio-transaction-system

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start Redis and Kafka
docker-compose up -d

# Build and launch the backend service
mvn clean install
java -jar target/app.jar

# Start the AI service
cd ai-service
python app.py
```

## Performance Testing
```yaml
- JMeter Load Tests: Validate system performance for handling 50K QPS.
- Response Time Analysis: Ensure 99% of requests complete within 300ms.
- AI Model Benchmarking: Validate fraud detection inference latency (<100ms).
```

## Deployment Strategy
```yaml
- Containerization: Dockerized backend and AI services for easy deployment.
- Orchestration: Kubernetes for auto-scaling and fault tolerance.
- Cloud Optimization: AWS Lambda for serverless AI model inference.
